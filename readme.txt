Monetize your content while enriching your readers' experience.  Augments
authoring capabilities and provides in-page searches.  

== Description ==

The famos plugin augments the authoring environment by providing annotation
suggestions as posts and/or comments are being written.  A variety of
annotation options are provided, including direct links to famos topic pages,
an aggregate search popup (the famos spotlight), and several other types.

Readers can also pull up the famos spotlight by selecting elements within the
page; the spotlight uses the selected elements as the basis for its initial
search results.

Any annotations followed by readers which result in economic activity will
have a portion of those monies attributed back to the page author and/or
WordPress site owner, who can collect those monies by providing famos with
payment information.
